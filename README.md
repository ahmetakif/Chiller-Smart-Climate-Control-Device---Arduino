# Purpose & Details

This device helps users control any heating system with ease. This smart heating/cooling system control device is developed for the order of the Kocaeli Metropolitan Municipality. In KBB Süleyman Demirel Culture Center, the chiller-rooftop heating/cooling systems are controlled with this device. Main control panels are made with 7-inch Nextion touch displays, and the controller board is an Arduino Nano. Multi DHT11 sensors in different places are used for correct temperature and humidity measurement. The device has different heating algorithms, and those can be selected from the settings screen. The device can tell the heaters and coolers when to heat or cool by sending them a signal with a relay over a digital pin. For timekeeping, a battery-powered RTC module is used.
